        <h1> ABOUT US</h1>
<h3> We are four Concordia Community, Public Affairs and Policy students all with different relationships to 'immigration'. Our project involves a panel and an archive of immmigrant self-narratives, art, and photography. Through this project we aim to dispell certain common myths, reframe the conversation around immigrants, remind people of immigrant voices, and humanize the conversation.</h3>
        <h1> OUR ARTISTS </h1>
<h3> We are currently searching for artists based in the city to display their works in collabration with us. We welcome all art on the subjects of migration, culture, and emotions. Please feel free to send us a message on instagram @.... or through our email at: immigrationpanl@gmail.com </h3>
